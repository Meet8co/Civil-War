    <section id="training">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Training</a></h2>
      <p>Soldiers should expect training to be challenging and rigorous. The training will consist of learning how to march, practice loading and firing guns, practicing drills, and learn to follow orders.</p>
      <p>Example of a daily training schedule:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Marching for hours every day with formations such as marching in column and in a "company front".</li>
        <li>Learn how to move in straight lines as a group.</li>
        <li>Learn how to put up tents and dig trenches quickly.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="uniforms">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Uniforms</a></h2>
      <p>Union soldiers wear blue, and Confederate soldiers wear gray. The uniforms are made of heavy wool, with leather-billed caps and stiff shoes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will wear a four-button "sack" coat over your cotton or flannel shirt, and trousers held by suspenders.</li>
        <li>The coat will have bright buttons, piping, or badges to indicate your rank.</li>
        <li>The Hardee hat, a wide-brimmed dress hat, is the regulation for the Union army.</li>
        <li>Confederate soldiers preferred the Slouch hat for its comfort, protection from the elements, and versatility.</li>
        <li>Brogan, an ankle-high leather shoe for all soldiers.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="health">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Health & Hygiene</a></h2>
      <p>Let me be honest — camp life isn’t always clean. But if you’re tough, you’ll be just fine!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We don’t always have real bathrooms or clean water.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, sickness spreads fast, like typhoid or dysentery.</li>
        <li>But if you keep yourself clean and smart, you’ll stay healthy!</li>
        <li>And don’t worry — everyone deals with a few bugs now and then.</li>
        <li>Stay strong, and you'll survive anything camp throws at you!</li>
        <li>We will provide hospitals, medical treatment, and nurses.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="battles">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Battles</a></h2>
      <p>Ready to prove your bravery? Battles are where heroes are made!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will march into battles.</li>
        <li>We use drums and flags to move together, even through all the smoke.</li>
        <li>It’s loud, it’s crazy, but when we win, it feels amazing!</li>
        <li>We fight in open fields — no hiding — just courage and teamwork.</li>
        <li>Stick with your friends, listen to your officer, and you’ll do great.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="camp">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Camp Life</a></h2>
      <p>When we are not fighting, camp becomes our home. You’ll will love it there!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We eat hardtack crackers, beans, and salty meat — keeps you strong!</li>
        <li>We pass the time by writing letters, playing cards, and telling jokes.</li>
        <li>The tents aren’t fancy, but after a long day, they will feel cozy.</li>
        <li>If you’re handy, you can even build wooden shelters!</li>
        <li>And we have chaplains who keep our spirits high when we miss home.</li>
      </ul>
