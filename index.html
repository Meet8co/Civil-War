      <h2><a target="_blank">Training</a></h2>
      <p>Soldiers should expect training to be challenging and rigorous. The training will consist of learning how to march, practice loading and firing guns, practicing drills, and learn to follow orders.</p>
      <p>Example of a daily training schedule:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Marching for hours every day with formations such as marching in column and in a "company front".</li>
        <li>Learn how to move in straight lines as a group.</li>
        <li>Learn how to put up tents and dig trenches quickly.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="uniforms">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Uniforms</a></h2>
      <p>Union soldiers wear blue, and Confederate soldiers wear gray. The uniforms are made of heavy wool, with leather-billed caps and stiff shoes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will wear a four-button "sack" coat over your cotton or flannel shirt, and trousers held by suspenders.</li>
        <li>The coat will have bright buttons, piping, or badges to indicate your rank.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="health">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Health & Hygiene</a></h2>
      <p>Being healthy in camp was super hard. There weren’t bathrooms or clean water, and people didn’t know about germs yet. More soldiers died from getting sick than from fighting.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diseases like typhoid and dysentery spread quickly.</li>
        <li>Hospitals were packed and didn’t have much medicine.</li>
        <li>Lots of bugs like lice made life uncomfortable.</li>
        <li>Sometimes they had to drink from puddles or dirty rivers.</li>
        <li>Even a little cut could get infected and become deadly.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="battles">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Battles</a></h2>
      <p>Fighting in the Civil War was super scary. There was smoke, noise, and people yelling everywhere. Soldiers marched into battle with guns and bayonets while cannons exploded around them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Famous battles were Gettysburg and Antietam.</li>
        <li>They used drums and flags to give commands.</li>
        <li>It was hard to see or hear because of all the noise and smoke.</li>
        <li>Battles often happened in open fields with no places to hide.</li>
        <li>Lots of people got hurt or worse in just a few minutes.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="camp">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Camp Life</a></h2>
      <p>When soldiers weren’t fighting, they lived in camps. Camp life could be boring and kinda gross, but soldiers found ways to have fun too.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They ate stuff like hard crackers (hardtack), beans, and salty meat.</li>
        <li>To pass time, they wrote letters, played cards, and told stories.</li>
        <li>The tents were small and didn’t keep them dry or warm very well.</li>
        <li>Sometimes they had to build shelters out of wood or dirt.</li>
        <li>Some camps had chaplains who helped soldiers stay positive.</li>
      </ul>
