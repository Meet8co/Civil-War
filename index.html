      <h2><a target="_blank">Training</a></h2>
      <p>Soldiers received limited training, mostly focused on marching, using rifles, and following orders. Drills were repetitive and discipline was strict to prepare men for battle.</p>
      <p>Training was tough and pretty boring. New soldiers had to practice marching and loading their guns over and over. Officers wanted them to learn how to follow orders quickly and work as a team.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice drills happened every day, sometimes for hours.</li>
        <li>Most soldiers had never been in the army before, so they had a lot to learn.</li>
        <li>Marching in a straight line was harder than it sounds!</li>
        <li>Soldiers also learned how to build fortifications and set up tents fast.</li>
        <li>Discipline was very strict—breaking the rules could lead to punishments like extra drills or even jail time.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="uniforms">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Uniforms</a></h2>
      <p>Union soldiers wore blue clothes, and Confederate soldiers usually wore gray or brown. But sometimes soldiers wore whatever they could get because supplies ran out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uniforms often didn’t fit well and got dirty fast.</li>
        <li>Confederate soldiers sometimes wore regular clothes from home.</li>
        <li>Badges and hats helped tell soldiers apart by rank.</li>
        <li>Clothing was made of wool, which was itchy and hot in the summer.</li>
        <li>Shoes were not always the right size and wore out quickly during long marches.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="health">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Health & Hygiene</a></h2>
      <p>Staying healthy was super hard. There were no good bathrooms or doctors, and people didn’t understand germs yet. More soldiers died from sickness than from fighting.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diseases like typhoid and dysentery spread quickly in camps.</li>
        <li>Hospitals were crowded, and doctors had limited tools.</li>
        <li>Lice, fleas, and bad food made life even worse.</li>
        <li>Many soldiers had to use rivers or puddles for drinking water, which made them sick.</li>
        <li>There were no antibiotics, so small wounds could turn deadly.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="battles">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Battles</a></h2>
      <p>Fighting in battles was scary and confusing. Soldiers had to march for miles and then charge into battle. They used guns, cannons, and even bayonets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some big battles were Gettysburg and Antietam.</li>
        <li>Soldiers used drums and flags to give commands.</li>
        <li>Smoke and noise made it hard to see or hear anything.</li>
        <li>Many battles took place in open fields, where soldiers had little cover.</li>
        <li>Cannonballs and musket fire could injure or kill dozens at once.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="camp">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Camp Life</a></h2>
      <p>When they weren’t fighting, soldiers lived in camps. Life in camp could be boring, dirty, and cold. But they tried to have fun too.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They ate hardtack (a hard cracker), beans, and salt pork.</li>
        <li>Soldiers wrote letters, played cards, and sang songs.</li>
        <li>Tents were small, and it was hard to stay warm and dry.</li>
        <li>They often had to build their own shelters if tents weren’t available.</li>
        <li>Many camps had chaplains or preachers who led prayers and helped keep spirits up.</li>
      </ul>
