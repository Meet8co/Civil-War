        <li>Recruits learned battlefield formations and commands.</li>
        <li>Many soldiers had no prior military experience.</li>

    <section id="uniforms">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Uniforms</a></h2>

    <section id="health">

      <ul>
        <li>Common diseases: dysentery, typhoid fever, pneumonia.</li>
        <li>Amputations were a frequent medical procedure.</li>

    <section id="camp">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Camp Life</a></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Food typically consisted of hardtack, salt pork, and beans.</li>
        <li>Letters from home were a major morale booster.</li>

      </ul>
