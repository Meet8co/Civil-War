      <h2><a target="_blank">Training</a></h2>
      <p>Training for Civil War soldiers was kinda hard and really boring. They had to march, practice loading and firing their guns, and learn to listen to orders. It wasn’t fun, but it helped them stay safe in battles.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They marched for hours every day.</li>
        <li>Most of them had never been in an army before.</li>
        <li>Learning to move in straight lines took a lot of practice.</li>
        <li>They also had to put up tents and dig trenches quickly.</li>
        <li>If they broke rules, they got punished with more drills.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="uniforms">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Uniforms</a></h2>
      <p>Union soldiers wore blue and Confederate soldiers wore gray or brown. Sometimes they just wore whatever they could find, because there weren’t always enough uniforms for everyone.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The clothes didn’t always fit and got super dirty.</li>
        <li>Some soldiers wore clothes from home.</li>
        <li>You could tell a soldier’s rank by the stuff on their uniform.</li>
        <li>Wool uniforms were itchy and hot in the summer.</li>
        <li>Shoes wore out fast and didn’t always fit right.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="health">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Health & Hygiene</a></h2>
      <p>Being healthy in camp was super hard. There weren’t bathrooms or clean water, and people didn’t know about germs yet. More soldiers died from getting sick than from fighting.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diseases like typhoid and dysentery spread quickly.</li>
        <li>Hospitals were packed and didn’t have much medicine.</li>
        <li>Lots of bugs like lice made life uncomfortable.</li>
        <li>Sometimes they had to drink from puddles or dirty rivers.</li>
        <li>Even a little cut could get infected and become deadly.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="battles">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Battles</a></h2>
      <p>Fighting in the Civil War was super scary. There was smoke, noise, and people yelling everywhere. Soldiers marched into battle with guns and bayonets while cannons exploded around them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Famous battles were Gettysburg and Antietam.</li>
        <li>They used drums and flags to give commands.</li>
        <li>It was hard to see or hear because of all the noise and smoke.</li>
        <li>Battles often happened in open fields with no places to hide.</li>
        <li>Lots of people got hurt or worse in just a few minutes.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="camp">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Camp Life</a></h2>
      <p>When soldiers weren’t fighting, they lived in camps. Camp life could be boring and kinda gross, but soldiers found ways to have fun too.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They ate stuff like hard crackers (hardtack), beans, and salty meat.</li>
        <li>To pass time, they wrote letters, played cards, and told stories.</li>
        <li>The tents were small and didn’t keep them dry or warm very well.</li>
        <li>Sometimes they had to build shelters out of wood or dirt.</li>
        <li>Some camps had chaplains who helped soldiers stay positive.</li>
      </ul>
