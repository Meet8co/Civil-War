      <h2><a target="_blank">Training</a></h2>
      <p>You should expect training to be challenging and rigorous. The training will include learning how to march, practice loading and firing weapons, conducting drills, and following orders.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of a daily training schedule:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Marching for hours everyday in formations, such as columns and creating a "company front."</li>
        <li>Learning how to move in straight lines as a group and quickly.</li>
        <li>Learning how to set up tents and dig trenches quickly.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="uniforms">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Uniforms</a></h2>
      <p>Union soldiers wear blue, and Confederate soldiers wear gray. The uniforms are made of heavy wool, with leather-billed caps and stiff shoes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will wear a four-button "sack" coat over your cotton or flannel shirt, and trousers held by suspenders.</li>
        <li>The coat will have bright buttons, piping, or badges to indicate your rank.</li>
        <li>The Hardee hat, a wide-brimmed dress hat, is the regulation for the Union army.</li>
        <li>Confederate soldiers preferred the Slouch hat for its comfort, protection from the elements, and versatility.</li>
        <li>All soldiers preferred the ankle-high leather shoe called Brogan.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="health">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Health & Hygiene</a></h2>
      <p>Let me be honest, camp life isn’t always clean. But if you’re tough, you’ll be just fine!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We don’t always have real bathrooms or clean water.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, sickness spreads fast, like typhoid or dysentery.</li>
        <li>But if you keep yourself clean and smart, you’ll stay healthy!</li>
        <li>Don’t worry, everyone deals with a few bugs now and then.</li>
        <li>We will provide hospitals, medical treatment, and nurses.</li>
        <li>Stay strong, and you'll survive anything and everything camp throws at you!</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="battles">
      <h2><a target="_blank">Battles</a></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>You’ll march into battles.</li>
        <li>We use drums and flags to move together, even through all the smoke.</li>
        <li>It’s loud and crazy, but when we win, it feels incredible!</li>
        <li>We fight in open fields, with no places to hide, relying solely on our courage and teamwork.</li>
