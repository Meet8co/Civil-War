      <h2>Training</h2>

        <li>Drill sessions could last for hours daily.</li>
        <li>Recruits learned battlefield formations and commands.</li>
        <li>Many soldiers had no prior military experience.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="uniforms">
      <h2>Uniforms</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Common diseases: dysentery, typhoid fever, pneumonia.</li>
        <li>Amputations were a frequent medical procedure.</li>

      <h2>Camp Life</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Food typically consisted of hardtack, salt pork, and beans.</li>
        <li>Letters from home were a major morale booster.</li>
        <li>Music and campfire stories were common entertainment.</li>
      </ul>
